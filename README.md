`pladito` is a Playdate emulator designed to test ((your games)) performance without requiring the actual hardware.

(Besides that, this is a study project about hardware emulation. It’s meant to be a fun playground for me.)

This software is similar to the Playdate Simulator in some ways, but it aims to more accurately replicate the real hardware.
The goal is to help Playdate developers test their games and ensure good performance for players.

This emulator is not intended to be an alternative for playing Playdate games without owning a Playdate.
I don’t want this software to become a piracy hub. Please use it to test your own games only.
